                                    The past years of my development experiance has been working on a multitude of projects
                                    utilising numerous technologies and reacting quickly to agile requirements.

                                    The languages and technologies used would be dependent on a project by project basis,
                                    I would reccomend the most suitable technogies to use for a project based on the
                                    requirements of the system, design, implement and deploy the solution.

                                    I obtained a First Class degree in Computer Studies from Liverpool John Moores
                                    University, my dissertation was based on Programme Management Software and the use of
                                    software within large corporations, I produced a piece of software which generated Gantt
                                    charts for the user and could predict time to complete a project based on the productivity
                                    of the team. Some of the modules studied at University were; Web Development, Database
                                    Systems, Mainframe Computing and Object Oriented Programming.

                                While working with Clinical Justice one of the side projects was to develop a system which could be
                                utilised to collect information from social media sources, this information could then be analysed with
                                a system such as GATE to semantically analyse the content of the strings of peoples posts or tweets. The
                                project that was created in light of these requirements was using Java, there is a twitter API which
                                allows users to collect data based on search parameters and this information is then relayed into the
                                ‘fire-hose’, the Java system would listen to the fire-hose and collect the information if certain further search
                                criteria was matched. The library that was used was based on JTwitter which provides a Java based
                                implementation to access the fire-hose. The system was adapted to listen for tweets coming from the UK
                                as that is where Clinical Justice operated, certain search teams were used such as ‘medical negligence’
                                and ‘justice’ which allowed the data to be filtered down by the fire-hose relatively well. The posts
                                were linked to a user so that a re-engagement with the customer could occur at a later
                                date.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Once the data has been collected, GATE was used to provide semantic al analysis on the search
                                terms collected so that the true meaning of the post could be deduced automatically, this filtered
                                list could then be used to re-engage with the people who had posted the status.

                                The Ingot Portal is a system that has been created and developed by Warrant Group over a long
                                period of time, there has been a few iterations of the product. These iterations have ranged from
                                standard HTML, CSS and PHP deployment to the latest version, which is utilising Symfony,
                                ExtJS and Doctrine to create a structured system which implements an MVC architecture to logically
                                separate the elements of the system. This system is used internally by the Warrant Group staff for management of
                                the system and also customers which are informed of status updates when there shipment reaches its
                                destination or there is a announcement made against it. The customers that Warrant Group deals with
                                previously had no way to automate the process of obtaining the information about where the items
                                were and the Ingot Portal enables the management and distribution of this information across a
                                wide user base effortlessly.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The main system that has revived most of my contributions is the Holiday System – this
                                system is for employees to log into to book, view and manage their holidays. Some of the manager
                                views that have been created in ExtJS are shown below which shows the use of context menus to
                                provide more user interaction with webpages which is generally expected now. ExtJs is considered
                                to be one of the hardest languages associated to JavaScript as it has such a steep learning
                                curve, however the documentation is excellent and this has made the creation of these systems very intuitive.

                            <div id="attachment_77" class="align_center">

                                </a>

                                <p>
                                    Context menus provide excellent user interaction and a much more
                                    intuitive user experience.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Another part of the system that has had serious development is the conflicting holidays view which is
                                data bound to the grid to accept and deny holidays. Once a users holiday request is selected the
                                grid refreshed to the date that the holiday request has been made for – the manager will be able to
                                view any holidays which conflict with this request and will be able to use their discretion to

                                Clinical Justice are a Liverpool based company where a new Website was developed to replace the old WordPress
                                website, for versatility purposes the switch to a non-CMS based approach was adopted. The new approach
                                was developed by hand with hand coded HTML following W3C’s recommendations and best practices, so that
                                the site would be viewable and accessible by everyone.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Some of the examples of the implementation of the website are below;</h3>

                            <p>
                                jMenu was used for the navigation on the website, there was a large array of pages which needed to be included,
                                a
                                multi tiered structure was required so that the menu’s can be dropped down into multiple times to get
                                to the required information. The styling of the jMenu that came by default was quite abrasive and the .js file
                                and the .css file which were supplied by this library were edited so that they followed a more subtle styling
                                which was more appropriate to the requirements of the website.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Prepared statements were using within PHP to stop any SQL Injection being able to output the data from a
                                database, PHP prepared statements require the use of mysqli or PDO, mysqli was used in this specific example,
                                the parameters are bound to the values before they are submitted which stops the statement being altered by
                                Injection attacks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A Captcha is used to hinder the use of bots for submitting information, SecurImage plugin was used to achieve the required functionality.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There was a requirement cURL for submitting the post data to multiple locations, through a third party library
                                which would deal with statistics about what pages the user viewed before they submitted a form and also to store
                                a copy of the information as a record into a MySQL database.

                                While working with Clinical Justice one of the projects was to develop a system which could be utilised
                                to collect information from social media sources such as Twitter, this information could then be analysed with
                                a system such as GATE to semantically analyse the content of the message to understand the meaning of posts or
                                tweets pragmatically. The project that was created in light of these requirements was using Java, there is a
                                twitter API which allows users to collect data based on search parameters and this information is then relayed
                                into the 'fire-hose', the Java system would listen to the fire-hose and collect the information if certain search
                                criteria was matched it would record this to Redis for later analysis. The library that was used was based on
                                JTwitter which provides a Java based implementation of the Twitter API. The system was adapted to listen
                                for tweets by geographical area, certain search teams were used such as ‘medical negligence’ and ‘justice’
                                which allowed the data to be filtered down by the fire-hose relatively well. The posts were linked to a user
                                so that a re-engagement with the customer could occur at a later date.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Once the data has been collected, GATE was used to provide semantic al analysis on the search
                                terms collected so that the true meaning of the post could be deduced automatically, this filtered
                                list could then be used to re-engage with the people who had posted the status.

                                On this project I worked closely with the development team to link the sever side code to the responsive
                                interface. I interfaced with the owners of the company to understand and develop their requirements and goals of
                                the website and convert these requirements into the finished application. The idea was to create a Pinterest
                                style board with multiple columns of pictures which show a picture of the recipe, but also the ability to add
                                them to the cart without viewing the item.

                                CSS3 was used to provide much of the functionality of the site such as text-overflow to hide any overflowing

                                implemented with Masonry JavaScript library for a cascading grid layout which could remove and add columns based
                                on the width of the page.
