                  <p>
                    The past years of my development experiance has been working
                    on a multitude of projects utilising numerous technologies
                    and reacting quickly to agile requirements. The languages
                    and technologies used would be dependent on a project by
                    project basis, I would reccomend the most suitable
                    technogies to use for a project based on the requirements of
                    the system, design, implement and deploy the solution.

                  <p>
                    I obtained a First Class degree in Computer Studies from
                    Liverpool John Moores University, my dissertation was based
                    on Programme Management Software and the use of software
                    within large corporations, I produced a piece of software
                    which generated Gantt charts for the user and could predict
                    time to complete a project based on the productivity of the
                    team. Some of the modules studied at University were; Web
                    Development, Database Systems, Mainframe Computing and
                    Object Oriented Programming.

                <p>
                  <strong>Contribution: </strong>Integration and adoption of
                  existing code base to change use and adapt to customer
                  requirements
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Technologies: </strong>Java, JTwitter, Flat File DB,
                  GATE
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Requirements: </strong>Collect information from social
                  media based on location of tweet and the information contained
                  within the post.
                </p>

                <p>
                  While working with Clinical Justice one of the side projects
                  was to develop a system which could be utilised to collect
                  information from social media sources, this information could
                  then be analysed with a system such as GATE to semantically
                  analyse the content of the strings of peoples posts or tweets.
                  The project that was created in light of these requirements
                  was using Java, there is a twitter API which allows users to
                  collect data based on search parameters and this information
                  is then relayed into the ‘fire-hose’, the Java system would
                  listen to the fire-hose and collect the information if certain
                  further search criteria was matched. The library that was used
                  was based on JTwitter which provides a Java based
                  implementation to access the fire-hose. The system was adapted
                  to listen for tweets coming from the UK as that is where
                  Clinical Justice operated, certain search teams were used such
                  as ‘medical negligence’ and ‘justice’ which allowed the data
                  to be filtered down by the fire-hose relatively well. The
                  posts were linked to a user so that a re-engagement with the
                  customer could occur at a later date.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Once the data has been collected, GATE was used to provide
                  semantic al analysis on the search terms collected so that the
                  true meaning of the post could be deduced automatically, this
                  filtered list could then be used to re-engage with the people
                  who had posted the status.

                  The Ingot Portal is a system that has been created and
                  developed by Warrant Group over a long period of time, there
                  has been a few iterations of the product. These iterations
                  have ranged from standard HTML, CSS and PHP deployment to the
                  latest version, which is utilising Symfony, ExtJS and Doctrine
                  to create a structured system which implements an MVC
                  architecture to logically separate the elements of the system.
                  This system is used internally by the Warrant Group staff for
                  management of the system and also customers which are informed
                  of status updates when there shipment reaches its destination
                  or there is a announcement made against it. The customers that
                  Warrant Group deals with previously had no way to automate the
                  process of obtaining the information about where the items
                  were and the Ingot Portal enables the management and
                  distribution of this information across a wide user base
                  effortlessly.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The main system that has revived most of my contributions is
                  the Holiday System – this system is for employees to log into
                  to book, view and manage their holidays. Some of the manager
                  views that have been created in ExtJS are shown below which
                  shows the use of context menus to provide more user
                  interaction with webpages which is generally expected now.
                  ExtJs is considered to be one of the hardest languages
                  associated to JavaScript as it has such a steep learning
                  curve, however the documentation is excellent and this has
                  made the creation of these systems very intuitive.
                </p>

                <div id="attachment_77" class="align_center">
                  <a href="img/projects/warrantgroup/extjs_grid.png">
                    <img
                      class="size-full"
                      title="Context Menu"
                      alt="context menu is displayed over a item being selected in a grid"
                      src="img/projects/warrantgroup/extjs_grid.png"
                      width="796"
                      height="229"
                    />
                  </a>

                  <p>
                    Context menus provide excellent user interaction and a much
                    more intuitive user experience.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                  Another part of the system that has had serious development is
                  the conflicting holidays view which is data bound to the grid
                  to accept and deny holidays. Once a users holiday request is
                  selected the grid refreshed to the date that the holiday
                  request has been made for – the manager will be able to view
                  any holidays which conflict with this request and will be able
                  to use their discretion to either accept or reject the holiday
                  request based on their requirements. Extensible was used to
                  provide the calendar functionality to the system which is a
                  plugin for ExtJS.

                  <p>
                    Data binding has been implemented which shows that the
                    holiday overlaps with someone else’s holiday – a very useful
                    tool for managers approving holidays when multiple people
                    from the same department can’t be off at the same time.

                  <p>
                    Data binding is also utilised on the auditing route of the
                    system, a user is selected within a department which then
                    shows that specific users holidays for that user, which can
                    be then be filtered down by year.

                  approach was adopted. The new approach was developed by hand
                  with hand coded HTML following W3C’s recommendations and best
                  practices, so that the site would be viewable and accessible
                  by everyone.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  Some of the examples of the implementation of the website are
                  below;
                </h3>

                <p>
                  jMenu was used for the navigation on the website, there was a
                  large array of pages which needed to be included, a multi
                  tiered structure was required so that the menu’s can be
                  dropped down into multiple times to get to the required
                  information. The styling of the jMenu that came by default was
                  quite abrasive and the .js file and the .css file which were
                  supplied by this library were edited so that they followed a
                  more subtle styling which was more appropriate to the
                  requirements of the website.

                  <p>
                    jMenu provides excellent functionality for creating tiered
                    menu structures.

                <h3>PHP validation for SQL injection and XSS</h3>

                <p>
                  Prepared statements were using within PHP to stop any SQL
                  Injection being able to output the data from a database, PHP
                  prepared statements require the use of mysqli or PDO, mysqli
                  was used in this specific example, the parameters are bound to
                  the values before they are submitted which stops the statement
                  being altered by Injection attacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A Captcha is used to hinder the use of bots for submitting
                  information, SecurImage plugin was used to achieve the
                  required functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There was a requirement cURL for submitting the post data to
                  multiple locations, through a third party library which would
                  deal with statistics about what pages the user viewed before
                  they submitted a form and also to store a copy of the
                  information as a record into a MySQL database.

                  <b>Requirements</b><strong>: </strong>Collect information from
                  social media based on location of tweet and the information
                  contained within the post.
                </p>

                <p>
                  While working with Clinical Justice one of the projects was to
                  develop a system which could be utilised to collect
                  information from social media sources such as Twitter, this
                  information could then be analysed with a system such as GATE
                  to semantically analyse the content of the message to
                  understand the meaning of posts or tweets pragmatically. The
                  project that was created in light of these requirements was
                  using Java, there is a twitter API which allows users to
                  collect data based on search parameters and this information
                  is then relayed into the 'fire-hose', the Java system would
                  listen to the fire-hose and collect the information if certain
                  search criteria was matched it would record this to Redis for
                  later analysis. The library that was used was based on
                  JTwitter which provides a Java based implementation of the
                  Twitter API. The system was adapted to listen for tweets by
                  geographical area, certain search teams were used such as
                  ‘medical negligence’ and ‘justice’ which allowed the data to
                  be filtered down by the fire-hose relatively well. The posts
                  were linked to a user so that a re-engagement with the
                  customer could occur at a later date.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Once the data has been collected, GATE was used to provide
                  semantic al analysis on the search terms collected so that the
                  true meaning of the post could be deduced automatically, this
                  filtered list could then be used to re-engage with the people
                  who had posted the status.

                <p>
                  On this project I worked closely with the development team to
                  link the sever side code to the responsive interface. I
                  interfaced with the owners of the company to understand and
                  develop their requirements and goals of the website and
                  convert these requirements into the finished application. The
                  idea was to create a Pinterest style board with multiple
                  columns of pictures which show a picture of the recipe, but
                  also the ability to add them to the cart without viewing the
                  item.
                </p>

                <p>
                  CSS3 was used to provide much of the functionality of the site
                  such as text-overflow to hide any overflowing text as the
                  recipes were aggregated automatically from outside sources.
                  The responsive recipe layout was implemented with Masonry
                  JavaScript library for a cascading grid layout which could
                  remove and add columns based on the width of the page.
